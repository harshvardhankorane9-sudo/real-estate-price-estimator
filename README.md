# 🏠 Bengaluru House Price Prediction

This is a simple machine learning project where I built an interactive web app that predicts house prices in Bengaluru based on parameters like area type, location, BHK, bathrooms, and total square feet.

I wanted to make something that’s not just about model training, but also looks good and is easy to use — so I built a small Streamlit app that gives instant predictions.

## 🔍 About the Project

The model is trained on a real Bengaluru housing dataset.  
I cleaned and processed the data using Pandas and NumPy, removed outliers, handled rare locations, and then used **Linear Regression** for prediction.

The app can take simple inputs from the user and shows the estimated price in **Lakhs** or **Crores** automatically.  
For example, if the prediction is 193 Lakhs, it shows it as **1.93 Crore**.
